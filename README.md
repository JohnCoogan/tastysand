Bayesian Classification of Tweets (detecting 'desert' / 'dessert' confusion).

## Description
This is a script I wrote to get a better grasp on Bayesian Classification. The goal of the project is to be able to scan the twitter stream for occurrances of either the word "desert" or "dessert" and accurately classify mis-uses of the former.

## Project Organization
*	Collect data from the twitter stream to analyze.
*	Manually classify mistakes (supervised learning).
*	Train and run the model.
*	Add live interaction layer to correct users.
